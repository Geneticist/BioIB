# BioID
The aim of this project is to analyse data from BioID experiments generated in our lab.
The BioID techique is used to identify proximal protein interactome. 
In our cas, we used the BioID technique to capture proximal interactors of MSN and CNK, two Drosophila protein.
Through the Data.Trek challenge, we want to find interesting ways to visualize our data. In addition, we want
to compare them to other relevant databases.
